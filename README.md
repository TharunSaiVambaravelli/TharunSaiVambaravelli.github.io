## Assignment - 2
## Part a(Personal Portifolio)
#### Software Systems Development
I created my portifolio website which contains following files:

1.`index.html`

2.`styles folder` which contains css file.

3.`scripts folder`which contains javascript file.

4.`images folder` which contains images used in the website.
## HTML
There is only single html page named `index.html`, which is divided using div tags.All these subdivisions are connected using a navigation bar.

## CSS
I have used google fonts for fonts and  font awesome library for icons on my website. I have also used an external css i.e. `style.css` for designing layout of html page. 

## JavaScript
I have used external js file i.e. `script.js` (for navigating around different tabs)
